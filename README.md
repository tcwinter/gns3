# Just trying to do anything in gns3

There were a few options to install gns3, but what I thought would be most convenient and work for me was to host the server on a VM in proxmox and use the same server to use the gui. 

Install the server and gui. 

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gns3/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gns3-gui gns3-server
```
Launch the server
