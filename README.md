# Just trying to do anything in gns3

There were a few options to install gns3, but what I thought would be most convenient and work for me was to host the server on a VM in proxmox and use the same server to use the gui. 

Installing the server and gui was the easy part. 

>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gns3/ppa
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt install gns3-gui gns3-server
